UMAP is a versatile and widely used technique.\n \n### **UMAP parameters**\n\nWe have some parameters that we can adjust depending the data that we are using. For example in the code above we use only three parameters.\n\n* **n_components**: Specifies the dimensionality of the low-dimensional embedding. \n\nBy default, it is 2,for visualization in a 2D plot. However, you can choose a higher value to obtain a higher-dimensional embedding if needed.\n\n* **n_neighbors**: This parameter determines the number of nearest neighbors used to construct the neighborhood graph. Increasing n_neighbors can capture more global structure, but may also increase computation time. A typical value is between 5 and 50, depending on the size and density of the dataset.\n\n* **min_dist**: It controls the minimum distance between points in the low-dimensional embedding. A smaller value of min_dist allows for tighter clustering, but can result in overfitting and crowded visualizations. Increasing min_dist encourages more even spacing between points.\n\n* **metric**: UMAP supports various distance metrics to measure similarity between data points in the high-dimensional space. Common choices include **Euclidean distance(default), Manhattan distance**, and others.\n\n* **random_state**: if we need to have reproducibility in our results, we can set a seed by using random_state.\n\n### Geometric Intuition of UMAP:\n\n**Step 1: Manifold Learning**\nUMAP aims to understand the intrinsic structure of your data, treating it as if it lies on a lower-dimensional manifold within the high-dimensional space.\n\n**Step 2: Local and Global Relationships**\n\n**Local Relationships**: UMAP focuses on preserving local relationships between data points, meaning points that are close to each other in the high-dimensional space should remain close in the lower-dimensional space.\n\n**Global Structures**: Simultaneously, UMAP strives to capture global structures, ensuring that broader patterns and arrangements are also maintained.\n\n**Step 3: Neighbors and Distances**\n\n**Neighborhood Concept**: For each data point, UMAP considers its neighborhood, defined by a certain number of nearest neighbors. This neighborhood is crucial for preserving local relationships.\n\n**Distance Metric**: UMAP uses a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance) to measure the similarity between data points within their neighborhoods.\n\n**Step 4: Fuzzy Topological Representation**\nUMAP introduces a fuzzy, topological representation of the data. This involves creating a set of relationships that capture both the near and far connections within the neighborhood.\n\n**Step 5: Optimization**\nUMAP utilizes Stochastic Gradient Descent as part of its optimization process. SGD helps in iteratively adjusting the low-dimensional representation of points to minimize the cost function, which balances the preservation of local and global structures based on the fuzzy topological relationships.\n\n**Step 6: Embedding in Lower Dimensions**\nThe result is an embedding of your data in a lower-dimensional space, where each point's position reflects its relationships with other points in the original high-dimensional space.\n\n**Step 7: Visualization**\nThis lower-dimensional representation is then often visualized to gain insights into the data's structure and relationships.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data Importing and Understanding\n\nFashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.

Choosing appropriate values for these parameters can require some trial and error.\n\n2. **Non-Reproducibility**:\n\nUMAP is inherently a stochastic algorithm, meaning it can provide slightly different results on each run. While this randomness aids in capturing complex structures, it may make direct comparisons or reproducing exact results challenging.
