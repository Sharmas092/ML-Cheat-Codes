    "\n",
    "1. Understand the business requirements and the nature of the available data.\n",
    "2. Classify the problem as supervised/unsupervised and regression/classification.\n",
    "3. Download, clean & explore the data and create new features that may improve models.\n",
    "4. Create training/test/validation sets and prepare the data for training ML models.\n",
    "5. Create a quick & easy baseline model to evaluate and benchmark future models.\n",
    "6. Pick a modeling strategy, train a model, and tune hyperparameters to achieve optimal fit.\n",
    "7. Experiment and combine results from multiple strategies to get a better result.\n",
    "8. Interpret models, study individual predictions, and present your findings. \n",

    "Most machine learning models are trained to serve a real-world use case. It's important to understand the business requirements, modeling objectives and the nature of the data available before you start building a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in any machine learning problem is to read the given documentation, talk to various stakeholders and identify the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the business problem you're trying to solve using machine learning?\n",
    "2. Why are we interested in solving this problem? What impact will it have on the business?\n",
    "3. How is this problem solved currently, without any machine learning tools?\n",
    "4. Who will use the results of this model, and how does it fit into other business processes?\n",
    "5. How much historical data do we have, and how was it collected?\n",
    "6. What features does the historical data contain? Does it contain the historical values for what we're trying to predict.\n",
    "7. What are some known issues with the data (data entry errors, missing data, differences in units etc.)\n",
    "8. Can we look at some sample rows from the dataset? How representative are they of the entire dataset.\n",
    "9. Where is the data stored and how will you get access to it?\n",
    "10. ...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Gather as much information about the problem as possible, so that you're clear understanding of the objective and feasibility of the project.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Loss functions** - they're used by computers to optimize the ML model\n",

    "\n",
    "Objectives of exploratory data analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Study the distributions of individual columns (uniform, normal, exponential)\n",
    "- Detect anomalies or errors in the data (e.g. missing/incorrect values)\n",
    "- Study the relationship of target column with other columns (linear, non-linear etc.)\n",
    "- Gather insights about the problem and the dataset\n",
    "- Come up with ideas for preprocessing and feature engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineer is the process of creating new features (columns) by transforming/combining existing features or by incorporating data from external sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here are some features that can be extracted from the \"Date\" column:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Day of week\n",
    "2. Day or month\n",
    "3. Month\n",
    "4. Year\n",
    "5. Weekend/Weekday\n",
    "6. Month/Quarter End\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using date information, we can also create new current columns like: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Weather on each day\n",
    "2. Whether the date was a public holiday\n",
    "3. Whether the store was running a promotion on that day.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Train/Test/Validation Split\n",
    "\n",
    "The data already contains a test set, which contains over one month of data after the end of the training set. We can apply a similar strategy to create a validation set. We'll the last 25% of rows for the validation set, after ordering by date\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input and Target columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also identify input and target columns. Note that we can't use the no. of customers as an input, because this information isn't available beforehand. Also, we needn't use all the available columns, we can start out with just a small subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imputation, Scaling and Encode\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's impute missing data from numeric columns and scale the values to the $(0, 1)$ range. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this step wasn't necessary for the store sales dataset, as there were no null values. Also, we can apply a different imputation strategy to different columns depending on their distributions (e.g. mean for normally distribute and median for exponentially distributed).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's encode categorical columns as one-hot vectors.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. We initialize a model with random parameters (weights & biases).\n",
    "2. We pass some inputs into the model to obtain predictions.\n",
    "3. We compare the model's predictions with the actual targets using the loss function.  \n",
    "4. We use an optimization technique (like least squares, gradient descent etc.) to reduce the loss by adjusting the weights & biases of the model\n",
    "5. We repeat steps 1 to 4 till the predictions from the model are good enough.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that a simple linear regression model isn't much better than our fixed baseline model which always predicts the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above baselines, we now know that any model we train should have ideally have a RMSE score lower than $2800. This baseline can also be conveyed to other stakeholders to get a sense of whether the range of loss makes sense. \n",
